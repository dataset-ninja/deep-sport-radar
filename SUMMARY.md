**DeepSportRadar Instance Segmentation Challenge v.2 Dataset** is a dataset for instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, object detection, and identification tasks. It is used in the sports industry. 

The dataset consists of 1456 images with 4104 labeled objects belonging to 2 different classes including *human* and *ball*.

Images in the DeepSportRadar dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into a semantic segmentation (only one mask for every class) or object detection (bounding boxes for every object) tasks. There are 842 (58% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *train* (1132 images), *test* (168 images), and *val* (156 images). Alternatively, the dataset could be split into 2 courts: ***camcourt 1*** (728 images) and ***camcourt 2*** (728 images), or into 15 arena labels: ***ks-fr-gravelines*** (516 images), ***ks-fr-nancy*** (160 images), ***ks-fr-blois*** (156 images), ***ks-fr-caen*** (124 images), ***ks-fr-fos*** (92 images), ***ks-fr-nantes*** (80 images), ***ks-fr-lemans*** (64 images), ***ks-fr-bourgeb*** (48 images), ***ks-fr-stchamond*** (48 images), ***ks-fr-monaco*** (36 images), ***ks-fr-vichy*** (36 images), ***ks-fr-limoges*** (32 images), ***ks-fr-strasbourg*** (32 images), ***ks-fr-poitiers*** (20 images), and ***ks-fr-roanne*** (12 images). Additionally, every image marked with its ***sequence***, ***game id***, ***league id*** and ***im id*** tags. The dataset was released in 2022 by the Sportradar AG, Switzerland.
