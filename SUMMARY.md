**DeepSportRadar Instance Segmentation Challenge v.2** is a dataset for instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and object detection tasks. It is used in the sports industry. 

The dataset consists of 1456 images with 4104 labeled objects belonging to 2 different classes including *human* and *ball*.

Images in the DeepSportRadar dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into a semantic segmentation (only one mask for every class) or object detection (bounding boxes for every object) tasks. There are 842 (58% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *train* (1132 images), *test* (168 images), and *val* (156 images). Alternatively, the dataset could be split into 2 courts: ***camcourt 1*** (728 images) and ***camcourt 2*** (728 images). Additionally, every image marked with its ***sequence*** tag. The dataset was released in 2022 by the Sportradar AG, Switzerland.
